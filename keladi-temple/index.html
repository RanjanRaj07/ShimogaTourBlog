        <strong>History of Keladi</strong><br>In the village of Hale-bayal, in the Keladi taluk of the Chandragutti paragana, two brothers named Chavuda Gowda and Bhadra Gowda had two slaves,
         Yadava and Murari, who worked in their owners' fields. After learning that one of their cows had been observed to leak milk over an anthill, Chavuda Gowda dug a modest temple over
         it after discovering that it contained a linga. A short while later, an ancient sword discovered by the servants during their plowing was inserted into the house's thatch with the
         intention of using it as a scythe. However, they found that the sword would emerge from its sheath like a serpent, killing any crow that happened to perch on the shed. After giving
         it a thorough cleaning and renaming it Nagaramuri, Chavuda Gowda took it and put it in his home. Another occasion saw the ploughshare collide with a cauldron's ring that held wealth.
         Fearful of upsetting it, Chavuda Gowda covered it up once more. However, that evening, he dreamed that he was instructed to present a human sacrifice and retrieve the treasure. 
         His two slaves, upon hearing this, offered to be the victims in exchange for having their memories kept. After making all the necessary preparations, the location was excavated 
         during the night, and the slaves, following their ablutions, bowed down to the cauldron and were executed by being beheaded with the Nagaramuri sword.
         <br>The Gowdas assembled a small army in response to their sudden fortune and started enslaving the nearby villages. However, the king ordered their seizure, sending them to Vijayanagar,
         where they were placed under arrest. Upon learning of a dissident Palegar near Balihalu, they offered, via the court musicians, to punish him, if they were permitted to do so.
         After obtaining permission, they led a group that killed the Palegar. After that, they were freed and verified to be in control of the locations they had taken, getting a seal (sikha moharu)
         from the king. Then the temple of Rameshwara and the town of Keladi were established.

         <strong>Prominent rulers of Keladi:</strong><br><strong>Shivappa Nayak:</strong>He overthrew his nephew to get to the throne, showed himself to be a capable ruler, and greatly enlarged the realm. 
         The British really valued Shivappa Nayak's approach to tax collecting, which promoted agriculture. His popularity among people of all generations is attested to by his statue and 
         the palace he erected.

        Nestled in the town that was ruled by Nayaks also known as Keladi rulers, the temple dating back to 1500 AD are an outstanding historic example of heritage and architecture.
        The temple was commissioned by Nayakas ruler, Chowdappa Nayaka. Nayakas, once a part of the Vijayanagara Dynasty ruled Ikkeri and Keladi and hence constructed the temples
        in these towns based on Hoysala- Dravidian style of architecture. Intricate and exquisite wooden carvings inside and outside the temple depicting various stories will 
        leave in spell-bound. Carvings of a woman paying homage to the deity Ganesh on a 24 feet high pillar in the backyard are believed to be of Keladi queen Chennamma who
        bravely fought Sultan Aurangzeb. Popularly known as Rameshwara Temple, the temple showcases the glorious past of the empire depicting the rich heritage, culture, 
        and art from the era.

    <p style="font-family: Garamond, serif">The main temple of this 16th-century structure, which greets visitors with immaculate gardens, features a Garbhagriha with Mukhamandapa and Mahamandapa.
    Take note of the Nandi facing Lord Shiva in front of the Rameshwara temple. Both Lord Veerabhadra and Rameshwara frequently wear these mandapas. Just beyond the Veerabhadra temple,
    the temple is situated on an elevated platform with a towering Dwajasthambam. On this Dwajasthambam is Lord Shiva's chariot, Nandi.

</div class="Gandaberunda">
<h2 style="font-family: unset;"><b>Gandaberunda</b></h2>
<p style="font-family: Garamond, serif">In Hindu mythology, Gandaberunda is a bird with two heads, a form that the Hindu god Vishnu takes on.
    It is thought to have extraordinary magical power. In Hindu mythology, Gandaberunda is a manifestation of Vishnu as Narasimha,
    who battled and defeated Sharabha, a dual form of Shiva and Hiranyakashipu.In most depictions, the eagle is seen holding two elephants
    in its beak and talons, displaying his great strength. He is depicted with a snake in his beak on a coin discovered in Madurai.
    In all two-dimensional representations, the double-headed eagle is shown symmetrically, but in some images, his long tail feathers resemble those of a peafowl. The two-faced eagle is shown in the Chennakeshava Temple in Beluru, Karnataka, Gandaberunda, as a "chain of destruction" scenario that ends with the universe being destroyed. Narasimha, the fourth avatara of Vishnu, assumed the secondary form Gandaberunda, and it was via this form that he simultaneously slew Hiranyakashipu and Sharabha.

<p style="font-family: Garamond, serif">The pillars are constructed from very dark brown wood.
 It is a wonder to see those carved bells on the wooden panels on the wall; an even bigger
 amazement is to see the wonderful carvings on the panel between the wall and ceiling that represent 
 many gods and old rites.Since the Lord Rameshwara temple is a Shiva temple, every carved image there belongs
to His family or clan. A set of Navagraha is visible on the ceiling.
