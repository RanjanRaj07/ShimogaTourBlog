            <p>Sigandur Kshetra of Goddess Choudeshwari of Sagar Karuru Hobali in Shimoga Shakti District of Karnataka State is an important area in the abode of deities. Sigandur Kshetra lies in the lap of the backwaters of Sharavati, in a beautiful and serene environment of lush greenery.It is famous as a rare religious field where there is no distinction between any caste and religion, and it is not seen from the point of view of rich and poor..Thousands of devotees come to the presence of Chaudamma who has a firm belief that she will never give up on those who are defeated. By placing their hardships and pains in the lap of the goddess, they get relief from their evil deeds.</p>
            <p>There is a hill on one side, a river on the other, and a dense forest called Shige Valley with a Kovu in the middle. It is called Devikanu. It is a traditional belief that the goddess roams in this forest as a forest deity. In this forest, Devi Bana is covered with bamboo, cane, shige, different species of trees. The base of Sigandur Chaudamma was the shapeless stone under the tree of Brahat Naga Sampige there. This stone was installed and worshiped in Sigandur temple in 1990 AD.
            In Linganamakki Reservoir, the original position of Jalodala is submerged to a depth of 25-30 feet when the reservoir is filled with water. Usually in April and May, when the water recedes, the origin of the goddess is visible.</p>
