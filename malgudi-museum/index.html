              <h2>About</h2>
              <p> Anyone who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s may identify with or comprehend the significance of Malgudi Days. Those were the days when every child's and even elder's evening consisted of running home from the playground upon hearing the famous song "tanaa na taana naa." The 1980s hit TV show "Malgudi Days" was based on R K Narayan's book of the same name. The book, which featured short stories from a Karnataka village centered around Swami, the young protagonist, and his pals, was first published in 1943. A youngster next door's incredibly relatable stories warmed millions of hearts. Malgudi was a made-up South Indian village.</p>
        <p>The book's short stories and simple narratives were filmed in Agumbe and nearby villages in the Karnataka region of Shimoga, capturing the feel of a traditional village. The series was filmed in the famous Arasalu railway station, which is featured in numerous episodes. Around and inside this station is where the village scene is set. The Mysuru Railway division chose to rehabilitate and transform the station into a Malgudi Museum including stories and excerpts from the television series and book as a tribute to the renowned writer R K Narayanan and the show.</p>
        <p>The Malgudi Museum was designed and built between 2019 and 2020. The majority of the series was filmed at the Arasalu railway station in Karnataka. By converting the station into a museum, Mysuru Division honors the station. The dilapidated and abandoned railway station structure is currently being renovated and revitalized to preserve the recollections of the past. Even after being broadcast on Doordarshan for so long, Malgudi Days continues to evoke strong feelings. Malgudi Days still excites everyone who has watched or worked on the series, as well as the residents of Agumbe and Arasalu.

        <p>The Shimoga district headquarters is only 34 kilometers from the Arasalu train station. Beautiful scenery and settings were used to develop and film the series' fictional town of Agumbe. Particularly after the rain, Agumbe and the Ghat region have some of the most picturesque vistas and scenery. Many stories and incidents are depicted on the walls of a little station on the Shivamogga-Talaguppa railway line that has been transformed into the Malgudi Museum. Upon entering the station, you will pass through a charming little garden and witness the famous Malgudi Chai café. The café has the vibe of a country café from the show because it is shaped like a purple train coach with two benches outside of it. The museum is filled with a variety of items that seem to be taken directly out of R. K. Narayana's stories, including pictures, artifacts, manuscripts, and vessels. When you go into the museum, the background music from Malgudi Days plays, transporting you to the time and place of the Malgudi Days. For all of the Malgudi and R K Narayanan enthusiasts, this British-era railway station is quite surprising.</p>
