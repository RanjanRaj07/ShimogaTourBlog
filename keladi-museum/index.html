              Stately Monument: Keladi Shivappanayaka Palace.
              Known for its sloping tile roof and mostly wooden construction, the Shivappanayaka palace has been around since the middle of the 17th century A.D. It was most likely ordered to be constructed by Venkatappanayaka (1590â€“1629 A.D.), 
              one of the strongmen of the Keladi dynasty (c. 1500 to 1763).During the reign of Shivappanayaka, the most famous dynasty, and in the early 1800s, it underwent renovations and modifications. 
              Perhaps at the beginning of the 20th century, a quadrangular pavilion was erected to the rear of the palace. The monument, measuring 30.00(l) by 15.00(b) by 9.50(h) metres, is elevated on a roughly 0.5-meter-tall plinth.
              It is made out of a large hall with columns that is approached from the front by five ramps spaced regularly apart.
              A balcony with a projection in the middle is located between the rooms.
        </p>

              Two staircases lead from the front floor to the balcony. Originally, this palace was far larger than it is today.
              Remaining brick walls from the debris clearance on the north-western side show two big, parallel halls measuring 9.50 by 1.50 metres each, as well as a large, quadrangular hall.  
              There are still certain parts of the palace that need to be located.Hallways measuring 9.50 by 1.50 metres and a roomy quadrangular room. There are still certain parts of the palace that need to be located.
              Between the balcony's pillars are engrailed arches that are typical of the Indo-Islamic style, and between the tall wooden pillars are pushpa bodigai in the Vijayanagar style.

              However, the shaft is tapering and fluted with a heavy square base and blossoming lotus motif, and the ornamental floral band engraved near the top is typical of the post-Vijayanagar indigenous style. 
              The balcony's projecting section may have been intended for the rulers to occasionally make formal appearances to the crowd of people assembled in front. Eight decorative stone plaques intended for sentinals are arranged in a columns at the front ground level.
