            Jog Falls is a waterfall on the Sharavati river located in Sagara taluk, Shivamogga District and its view point located in Shimoga district of Karnataka, India. 
            It is the second highest plunge waterfall in India. It is a segmented waterfall which depends on rain and season to become a plunge waterfall. 
            The falls are major attractions for tourists and is ranked 36th in the list of free-falling waterfalls, 490th in the world by list of waterfalls by total height, 128th in the list of single-drop waterfalls in the World by the waterfall database. </p>
        <p>The Sharavathi river, which originates near Nonabur at Ambutirtha in Thirthahalli taluk, flows northwest through Fatte petta before meeting the Yenne Hole above Barangi and the Haridravati below Pattaguppe on the left. 
            It then curves to the west, plunges down the Jog Falls (also known as Gersoppa Falls), and passes via the village of Gersoppa (really known as Geru-Sappe), some 30 kilometers (19 mi) further, before emptying into the Arabian Sea near Honnavar in Uttara Kannada.</p>
        <p>The 290-meter-deep Sharavathi River flows over a stony bank for around 250 yards (230 meters) before plunging into a massive abyss. The water falls into four different falls, named <b>Raja, Rani, Roarer, and Rocket</b>. The Raja Fall plunges 250 meters (830 feet) below the surface in a single, uninterrupted column. The Roarer appears halfway down and instantly transforms into a massive cup before hurriedly falling to meet the Raja. With a sequence of jets, the Rocket launches downward. The Rani glides silently in a sheet of foam across the slope. 
            The tourism department constructed steps to descend from the highest viewpoint, which offers a view of the waterfall from across the hill.
            There are approximately 1,400 steps made to reach the bottom of the hill. <br>

            The neighboring Sharavati River crossing Linganamakki Dam is connected to the waterfall. With a capacity of 120 MW, the power plant was one of the biggest hydroelectric plants in India when it first started operating in 1948 and currently provides Karnataka with a modest amount of electricity. Krishna Rajendra hydroelectric project was the previous name of the power plant, which was named after the Mysore King at the time. 
            Later on, the project was renamed the Mahatma Gandhi Hydroelectric Project. Up until 1960, the Hirebhaskara dam provided water for it. 
            The Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya ideas led to the utilization of Linganmakki Dam for power generation after 1960. <br>
            The Jog Falls are just two thin streams of water trickling down the cliff before the monsoon season begins, when there isn't much water in the Linganmakki dam. This is because the water collected in the dam is used only to generate electricity; during the monsoon, the falls are fed by local rainfall.
