        <p style="font-family: Garamond, serif">A hamlet called Ikkeri is located in the Sagara taluk (township), about 6 km south of the Sagara town centre. The temple honoring a Shiva avatar, Aghoreshvara, is what makes it famous. 
            "Two streets" is the translation of the Kannada term Ikkeri.
            <br> This historic Ikkeri village and its Aghoreshwara Temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, are only approximately 6 km from Sagar.
            The Kannada word for Ikkeri, the former name of the Keladi Nayaks' capital, is "Two Streets." During the 16th and 17th centuries, Ikkeri served as the seat of the Keladi Nayaka Dynasty's government. 
            Even after so many years, Aghoreshwara, a historic heritage temple, tells volumes about its illustrious past.

    <p style="font-family: Garamond, serif">
        <strong>Nayakas of Ikkeri</strong><br>It served as the seat of the Nayakas of Keladi's empire from roughly 1560 to 1640 AD until being relocated to Bednur Nagara. 
        Despite the fact that the mint was no longer there, Ikkeri was still designated as the nominal capital, and the coins were still referred to as Ikkeri Pagodas and Fanams. 
        Its extensive walls formed three concentric enclosures. The palace, made of mud and wood and decorated with carving and fake gold leaf, was located inside the fortress. 
        The temple of Aghoreshvara, a sizable and perfectly proportioned stone structure, is the only reminder of its previous splendour. Three effigies of the Keladi chiefs, 
        each with their name engraved above them, are placed on the floor in front of the shrine. 
        Huchcha (Mad) Somasekhara is seen to be fettered and manacled. As a standard for measuring garden land, the distance between the pillars in the centre was chosen. 
        The shist was fixed on 1,000 such daya at varied rates, made in a mixed style with a unique conception, and was equivalent in length to one rod, or 18 feet 6 inches, 
        the area named daya permitted for one tree.

    <p style="font-family: Garamond, serif">
        With its twin temple Keladi, Aghoreshwara Temple, also known as Ikkeri Temple, is frequently visited. The Nayaks' love of the best craftsmanship and building is perfectly demonstrated by these two temples. 
        The finest details were used to build a distinctive structure. While visiting Shimoga or the Malanadu region, one must pay these temples a visit.
        The Shivalinga in the Ikkeri temple is thought to be a self-manifested deity that was discovered in Shimoga's dense jungles. From 1560 until 1640 AD, Ikkeri was under Keladi Nayakas' rule. 
        For more than a century prior to Hyder Ali's invasion, the Nayakas had a firm grip on the Malanadu region.
        At the entrance, a large, gleaming Nandi is sitting beneath a portico to greet visitors.

    <h2 style="font-family: Garamond, serif"><b>Hightlights of Agoreshwara Temple</b></h2>
    <p style="font-family: Garamond, serif">The earlier-mentioned Aghoresvara temple is a sizable, granite construction with a distinctively blended design that borrows features from Vijayanagara architecture, the Karnataka Dravida style of the Later Chalukya dynasty, and the Hoysala Empire.
        <br>There are three shrines: a large Aghoresvara (Shiva) shrine, a Parvati shrine to its left, and a Nandi shrine in the front.
        <br>The temple faces north and features a tall roof as well as decorative portals on its west, north, and east sides. The north entryway is the best, with two elephants flanking it. 
        The enormous pedestal, known as the Shakti Peetha, is part of the Garbhagriha, which is made of enormous stones. It takes up approximately three-fourths of the entire structure. 
        There is a tiny translucent Nandi in the Sukhanasi.

    <p style="font-family: Garamond, serif">A huge shining Nandi sitting under a porch at the entrance welcomes the pilgrims and tourists carved in the typical Indo-Islamic style of architecture of the 16th century. 
        The enormous carvings of Hindu deities, dancing girls, animals, stories, Gods, and Goddesses leave the visitors awestruck</p>
